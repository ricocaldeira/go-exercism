## Instructions

If you've downloaded the [command-line client](http://exercism.io/clients/cli) and have Go installed on your machine, then go ahead and fetch the first problem.

```
exercism fetch go
```

In order to be able to submit your solution, you'll need to configure the client with your [Exercism API key](http://exercism.io/account/key)

```
exercism configure --key=YOUR_EXERCISM_KEY
```

When you've written a solution, submit it to the site. You'll have to configure the command-line client with your exercism API key before you can submit.
